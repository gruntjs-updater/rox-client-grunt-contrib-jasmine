# rox-client-grunt-contrib-jasmine

> Client to send test results to [ROX Center](https://github.com/lotaris/rox-center) with [grunt-contrib-jasmine](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jasmine).



## Getting Started

This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.2`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install rox-client-grunt-contrib-jasmine --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('rox-client-grunt-contrib-jasmine');
```



## Contributing

In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).
